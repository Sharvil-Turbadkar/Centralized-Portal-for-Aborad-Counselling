#Centralized-Portal-for-Aborad-Counselling

As of now India does not have any system in place that helps students with a centralized experience. 
Many students pursuing masters must go through an arduous process of paying hefty fees to commercialized counselors The student must go through many hassles and mundane loads like getting recommendation from multiple teachers without having any prior knowledge of which teachers’ recommendation would boost their profile the most.  
Counselling companies have multiple students under their supervision and are all governed by a manager. 
Thus, catering to every student ‘s doubt and giving every student his respective university list becomes a hassle due to time constraint as there are many factors to be taken into consideration. 
Students must book appointments 2-3 weeks prior till which their process is stalled thus making it cumbersome for student to carry on with their formalities  Keeping legacy data to help future batches is also not in place as forms and log reports generated are backed by manual entries and making an accurate foolproof prediction for the student becomes very tough   
Thus, I plan on making a database that enhances the student experience.  The solution I propose plans to make student experience hassle free by centralizing the experience gathering counsellors and students online on a single portal.  Many Counsellors and students alike who have pursued their education abroad have prior knowledge of how the formalities and system fall into place. Their knowledge if they wish on sharing can be utilized utmost by signing them up on the portal.  By centralizing many key drawbacks can be curbed and the entire process can be enhanced and expedited at the same time as students get personalized attention, counselors get their slots booked automatically given availabilities along with getting paid depending upon the total number of hours dedicated to a student.
# Abstract: We created this project to enhance the student and counselor experience by connecting them on a common CRM portal counselors counsel students. While making the database system when a counselor counsels a student the counselor is not available to other students as he is busy. The Database model is time and money efficient as auto assigns universities to students based on their academic profiles and computes counselors payrolls
